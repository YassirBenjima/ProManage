This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Environment Variables

Before running the development server, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following Clerk authentication keys:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

You can get these keys from your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

## Database Setup

This project uses Prisma as the database ORM. After setting up your environment variables, run the following commands to set up your database:

1. **Run migrations** to create the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_models
```

2. **Generate Prisma client** to update the database client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

3. **View your database tables** (optional) using Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
